#### Hi, I’m Leo 👋

I don't follow trends the way many in the tech community do,
and I don’t believe the world is in urgent need of AGI.
Instead, I’m more interested in developing robust solutions for cross-platform,
collaborative, local-first, server-_less_ (in the literal sense) applications - 
without requiring an army of PhDs to build and deploy.
Think of something like iCloud, but liberated from 🍎’s golden cage.

I’ve had the privilege of studying extensively, 
first with a Bachelor’s in Business Administration from the
[University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de/en/), 
followed by another one in Computer Science from the 
[Technical University of Munich](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/home/). 
Currently, I’m finishing my Master’s in
[Data Engineering and Analytics](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/studies/degree-programs/master-data-engineering-and-analytics/). 
Over the years, I’ve also had the responsibility of writing some critical software components
for the fintech company [Lavego AG](https://www.lavego.de) (now acquired by [myPOS](https://www.mypos.com/)).

You might find me on some social media platforms, though they’re mostly dormant,
as I find them less valuable these days.
I prefer more personal forms of communication, like messaging.
If you want to reach out, feel free to use (in order of preference and responsiveness):
Signal, Email, or Discord. You can find my handles in my profile (👀 to the left on Desktop). 

Here's the link to my [blog](https://github.com/lstwn/blog) where I sporadically write something.
